  a catkin-related directory, .

CMake Warning at thermalvis-master/cmake/configure/framework.cmake:40 (MESSAGE):
  Even though catkin has been found, <BUILD_FOR_ROS> has already been set
  false so this will be treated as a non-ROS build.

CMake Warning (dev) at thermalvis-master/cmake/find/avutil.cmake:11 (if):
  Policy CMP0054 is not set: Only interpret if() arguments as variables or
  keywords when unquoted.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0054" for policy
  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  Quoted variables like "AVUTIL_LIBRARY" will no longer be dereferenced when
  the policy is set to NEW.  Since the policy is not set the OLD behavior
  will be used.
