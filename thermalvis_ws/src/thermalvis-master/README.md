# thermalvis

Cross-platform, OpenCV-based functionality for image processing and computer vision in thermal-infrared.
If you are using a thermal-infrared camera I can almost guarantee this software will be useful to you. 
However, there are plenty of features that could also be useful for those using conventional cameras or other related devices.

Please explore the [wiki](https://github.com/steevo87/thermalvis/wiki) for more information.
